My First Mini Project
This is my very first mini project, inspired by the secondhand dealership from Gran Turismo 7.

Showcasing Cars Across Decades
The single-page application showcases a variety of cars ranging from 1970 to 2020, displaying details such as images, brands, models, and years. It also features a filter that allows users to easily browse cars by decade.

Simple and Functional Design
The design utilizes basic CSS, a Bootstrap layout, Iconify icons, and Google Fonts, combining simplicity with efficiency for a clean, functional user interface.

Dynamic Data with Local API
The project makes use of a local API to store car information and dynamically fetch and display it on the page, providing a seamless and interactive experience.
